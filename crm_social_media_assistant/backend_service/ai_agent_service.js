        Tweet from user "${tweetAuthor}":
        ---
        ${tweetText}
        ---

        Analyze the tweet based on the following criteria:
        1.  **sentiment**: Classify the sentiment as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.
        2.  **is_lead**: Determine if this tweet represents a potential sales lead. This is true if the user expresses interest in the product, asks about pricing, features, demos, or compares it to a competitor. It is false if they are just complaining, asking for support, or making a general comment.
        3.  **suggested_action**: Based on the analysis, suggest a concrete next step for the social media manager. Examples: "Create lead in CRM and reply with pricing info.", "Reply with a link to the support documentation.", "Thank the user for their positive feedback."

        Provide your response ONLY as a valid JSON object in the following format:
        {
          "sentiment": "...",
          "is_lead": boolean,
          "suggested_action": "..."
